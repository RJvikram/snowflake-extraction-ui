## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Walkthrough

### 1. **Imports and Config**

- Imports Streamlit, Snowflake connector, Pandas, and UUID.
- Sets up the Streamlit page title and layout.

### 2. **Snowflake Connection**

- Uses `st.cache_resource` to cache the Snowflake connection.
- Reads credentials from `st.secrets["snowflake"]`.

### 3. **Source Selection**

- Fetches available TABLES or VIEWS from Snowflake.
- Lets the user select a source and displays its columns.

### 4. **Configuration Name**

- Allows selection of an existing configuration (placeholder) or entry of a new configuration name.

### 5. **Global Extract Filters**

- User specifies the number of filters (1-5).
- For each filter, user selects column, condition, value(s), logic (AND/OR), and case sensitivity.
- Filters are combined into a SQL WHERE clause.

### 6. **CASE WHEN Rules Engine**

- Optionally add a CASE WHEN rule to create a new derived column.
- User specifies rule name, description, column, operator, value, THEN, ELSE, and new column name.

### 7. **SQL Generation**

- Dynamically builds the SQL query based on selected filters and rules.
- Shows the generated SQL for preview.

### 8. **Preview Results**

- Executes the generated SQL and displays the result as a table.

### 9. **Save Configuration as View**

- Allows saving the current configuration as a new Snowflake view.

### 10. **Upload CSV to Insert Data**

- User can upload a CSV file.
- Displays the uploaded data.
- Inserts the data into the selected table in Snowflake.
